# CogSci-Projects-Practice

Welcome to the CogSci-Projects-Practice repository!
This is my sandbox for testing and experimenting with various projects.

## Description
This repository serves as a playground for various cognitive science-related projects and experiments.
Dive in to explore the different Jupyter notebooks and their implementations.

## Latest Updates
I'm currently working on the **H&H_FT_NN.ipynb** which simulates a single neuron, where its signal is then processed for its PSD
and is then used to train an MLP that learns the neuron activation based on the PSD and time. I've managed to get the first few ms of the 
activation but the MLP needs a lot more tweaking to learn the entire signal.
- Make MLP more efficient (possibly a new NN method)
- Use genetics for optimal weights (this might cancel the need for a new NN method)

## Contents
